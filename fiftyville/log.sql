-- Ruth    Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief
--         get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
--         If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot,
--         you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot
--         in that time frame.

-- Eugene  I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
--         Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was
--         walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there
--         withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who
--         talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the
--         thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out
--         of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the
--         other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
