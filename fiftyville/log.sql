--         walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there
--         withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who
--         talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the
--         thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out
--         of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the
--         other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
