How do you know?: TODO
This algorithm sorted the sorted array more faster then sort 3. It has Ω(n^2).

sort2 uses: TODO
This is a merge sort algorithm

How do you know?: TODO
It is the fastiest algorithm to compare with sort 1 and sort 3 algorithms. It has O(n logn) and Ω(n log n).

sort3 uses: TODO
This is a selection sort algorithm

How do you know?: TODO
It takes the longest time to sort sorted array. It has Ω(n^2).
